### Snake stuff
Every snake AI is, by defenition, a [Markov decision process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process) with the 4 directions it can choose as action *a*, and the board state as *s*.
This means we should train our AI using [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning).
