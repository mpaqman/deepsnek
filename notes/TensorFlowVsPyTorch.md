Based off [this blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-spotting-the-difference-25c75777377b).

## Smilarities
* Both use tensors
* Both treat models as [directed acyclic graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)
## Differences

|PyTorch|TensorFlow|
| :---: | :---: |
| Facebook | Google |
| In Beta | The current "standard" |
| Update model on the fly (nice for dynamic inputs) | Define graph statically before running model |

This is incomplete, read more from the above blog (I noted up to difference #1)
